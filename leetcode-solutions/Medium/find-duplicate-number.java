/**
 * LeetCode Problem: 287. Find the Duplicate Number
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/
 * 
 * Approach:
 * - Treat the array as a linked list: index as node, nums[i] as next pointer
 * - Apply Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection to find the entrance of the cycle
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)

        slow = nums[0]; // reset slow to beginning
